###Tor Browser (Vidalia Bundle)###
    
    About: A bundle that includes all necessary components for browsing the Tor network. Tor helps ensure anonymity by 
    routing internet traffic through a series of nodes in order to hide the requestor, making spying by traffic analysis 
    methods difficult. Tor is also necessary for accessing the "deep web" of hidden "onion" websites that are invisible to 
    common web browsers. Addresses for Tor only deep web sites are recognizable by their .onion extension, with a URL 
    format similar to http://afj20g82gvn251nao20581hgj15hgo0.onion

    intel by the U.S. gov't. Allows for creation and encryp/decryp of hidden mountable volumes. Create standard, 
    partitioned, and nested encrypted volumes. Nested volumes are of special note as they allow for many layers 
    of passwords that can be revealed under duress without exposing the existence of any other encrypted volumes.

###uTorrent###

    About: A lightweight application for downloading torrents. Remember to seed kids :)
    
    File: uTorrent.dmg.zip
    
###wget###

    About: Unix command line util for fetching files via HTTP/S & FTP protocols.

    Example: I find this especially useful for profiling a website's directory structure or for creating a 
    copy of the entire site as it appears in a browser to a user. My most used command is "wget -r http://thesite.com" 
    which would recursively download all spiderable pages at http://thesite.com. Note the word "spiderable," as the copy 
    downloaded can only reach pages that are linked to and cannot download orphan files and pages that may be present.
